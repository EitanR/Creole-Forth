<p>Creole Forth - a scripting language in the form of a Delphi/Lazarus
component. </p>

<p>Why I wrote it</p>

<p>Forth is a simple stack based language commonly used in resource-constrained 
systems. I don't normally work in those environments. Developing my own version 
of Forth gave me the opportunity to use it on my own projects. </p>

<p>Why I'm proud of it</p>

<p>My scripting language takes many of the best features of Forth and adds it own
unusual set of features. It is nearly trivial to add to any Delphi or Lazarus
application - simply drop the TCreole component on a form, set a few properties
and call an initialization method, and then submit commands to it. </p>

<p>As an extensible embedded language it has some similarities to Tcl. However, it
is much simpler in terms of both code and in the ease a developer can add extensions
to the language. </p>

<p>Creole Forth's features include strings as first-class objects, simple codebase 
(about 3000 lines), and easy extensibility. I am proud to say I have used it 
for many projects both for my personal use and  for clients. </p>
