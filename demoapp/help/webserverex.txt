To execute the web server example, do the following steps :

1. Switch the web server on. This is done by going to the
   two radio buttons where it says 'Toggle Web Server' and
   clicking the On button.

2. Go to your web browser and type the following on the
   URL line : http://localhost:3535. This will bring up the 
   home page of the web server. It may take a few seconds
   to come up. 

3. There are three examples on the home page :
   A. Generation of a date/time stamp.
   B. An RPN calculator.
   C. Generation of a page which shows the contents of the Creole dictionary. 
      
4. Click on each example in turn. In each case, you will see on the bottom
   a button which will bring you back to the home page when clicked.


5. The web pages are generated dynamically by Creole dictionary definitions. 
   A partial exception to this is the home page, which is produced by a
   word that loads a real file as a template.
