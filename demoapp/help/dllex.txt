There are two parts to this example. The first one
calls the external function EnumerateWindows, and
the second one gives a simple application of the
SendKeys function in the dll library file SK8765.DLL.

To see the first example, simply click the Enumerate
Windows button. The Memo field above will be populated
by all the currently active windows running along with
their associated file handles.

For the second example, type in some text where it 
says 'Text to send' and then hit the 'Send Text to Notepad'
button. Notepad will be executed and as the window currently
in the foreground, it will receive the text. 

While these are both limited examples, they show the
possibilities of interfacing Creole to low-level external
libraries that are often written in another language 
(such as C). All that needs to be done is to have a
wrapper procedure written around them that has the
Creole primitive parameter list and reference them using
the BuildPrimitive method. These parameters are as follows :

Owner : TCOmponent. Refers to the container form that
the Creole component attaches itself to.

EI : TExtInterface. Interfaces with stacks, input, PAD,
and output and has fields and routines associated with
their manipulation.

DI : TDictInterface. Dictionary interface and associated
routines.

CI : Control interface. Stores configuration and startup
information for Creole (not currently used).

CWI : TCreoleWord. A descendant of TObject. Below are its most
important fields.

1. Namefield.
2. IndexField. Index in dictionary (or address)
3. CodeField. procedural type or pointer to a primitive procedure
   which has the Owner,EI,DI,CI,CWI parameter list.
4. Parameter Field. An integer array holding indexes to Creole words
   in the dictionary. High level definitions are essentially assemblages
   of indexes to words in the dictionary that reside in their parameter field.
5. Data field. Stores data for the word.
6. TypeField. string showing type of word; ie primitive, colon, defining.
7. Vocabulary. Vocabulary word was defined in. 
8. RedefinedField. Address of word with the same name that was defined before it
   (if any).
9. HelpField. Field for storing online help.
