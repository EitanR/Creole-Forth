Example 1. Interfacing Creole with a Perl script

To do this example, Perl for Windows needs to be installed on
your system. Activestate Perl is on the CD that came with this
demo in the \install subdirectory and should be installed before
proceeding further.

Step 1 : High-level definition.

Type the following into the input field of the demo application,
and then click on the submit button.

: PICKSCRIPT DLG PSCRIPT ;

DLG creates a dialog box which allows the user to pick a file
and then leaves the file name on the data stack. PSCRIPT is a
defining word that takes a filename as its argument. The filename
must have a .pl extension. Its runtime action is to execute a 
Perl script.

Step 2 : Creating the script alias using a dialog box.

Once this is done, type in the following and submit again :

PICKSCRIPT RTEST

This action will produce the dialog box. Please select the 
single Perl file in the subdirectory rtest.pl. Once this is
done, the filename will be compiled into the word definition
and it can be executed simply by typing its alias RTEST.

Step 3 : Executing the script with its arguments on the stack.

RTEST takes two arguments, a seed number and the number of
random numbers to generate. 

You can type 1234 100 RTEST or place their arguments directly
on the stack if you like (remember to put 1234 underneath 100
if you do so). Once RTEST is executed with its two arguments,
a dialog box will pop up informing you that the script has been
executed. The series of random numbers will be returned to the
data stack.
